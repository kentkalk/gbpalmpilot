This is a simple project that is the beginning of a shoot-em up game for the Game Boy written in assembler.  At the moment it is able to scroll the background and the plane can move in all 4 directions on the screen.  There is also the beginnings of an enemy that can track the player.  No collision exists yet.  The intent was to use scrolling background to create a bullet-hell type environment with a collision matrix.  None of this has been implemented, and this is just being posted for my own archival as I'm not currently working on it.

Uses the RGBASM package for assembling and linking.
Find the playable ROM in the "out" folder, works in any Game Boy emulator I've tested, along with real hardware.
